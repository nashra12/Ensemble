    "Q3. What is bagging?\n",
    "Ans=>Supose we are having a dataset and lets say m1,m2,m3...mn are models where models can be repeated called base learners suppose m1 model gives 1 as output,m2 gives 0 as output,m3 gives 1 as output.. and so on and maximum occurance is 0 then output will be 0,but in the case of regression ans will be average."
